👋 Mohammed Falahi — AI & Automation Engineer

I design and build agentic AI systems that turn real-world workflows into autonomous software.

My work focuses on LLM applications, RAG pipelines, multi-agent orchestration, and production AI APIs — from retail assistants and forecasting engines to communication automation platforms.

🔧 Core Focus
• Agentic AI & AI Automation
• LLM Applications (RAG, Tool Calling, Reasoning Workflows)
• FastAPI-based AI Backends & Deployments
• Data Pipelines & Decision Systems

🚀 I like building practical AI — systems that reduce manual work, not demo notebooks.

Open to collaborating on real-world AI products and automation tools.
