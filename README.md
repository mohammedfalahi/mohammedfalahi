## 👨‍💻 Mohammed Falahi

**AI & Automation Engineer | Agentic AI Systems Builder**

I build practical AI systems that automate real-world workflows.

My focus is on designing agentic applications powered by LLMs — systems that reason, retrieve knowledge, call tools, and execute multi-step tasks instead of just generating text. I work across backend engineering, data pipelines, and model deployment to turn AI ideas into usable products.

### 🧠 Engineering Approach

I prefer building reliable, grounded systems over experimental demos — focusing on accuracy, fallback logic, and real usability.
Most of my projects aim to reduce manual effort through decision-driven automation.
